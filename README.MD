          Lunakin Quarmified


Looking at old EQinterfaces I discovered I quite like some of the old Lunakins work!

As an homage to his work I have decided to tweak the ui a bit and add several color options for those that want this minimalistic no frills ui in their game.


In the Options folder you will see the COLORS folder with several palette choices and each one filled with TGA files you need to copy and paste in the main folder.

The main UI comes in Black as that is the most streamlined visually but you can choose any of the colors included to spice it up.

I am also open to color requests in discord or here as well.

Many thanks to Lunakin for the work done on this ui and this is a new version that will be improved as Quarm grows!

- There are several new pieces included in v 2.0 in the options folder, you can get some horizontal modded pieces for Lunakin Quarmified there!

Any issue please write to me here or in the UI discord channel for Project Quarm, I always take requests and open to new ideas! Some of the modifications I have added were customs requests!

Hugs to everybody!
